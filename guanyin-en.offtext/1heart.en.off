The noble Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, while practicing the profound practice of perfection of wisdom, 
examined the five aggregates and saw them empty of self-nature.

Here, Sāriputta, form is emptiness, and emptiness is as form; 
emptiness is not different from form, and form is not different from emptiness; 
that which is form is emptiness, and that which is emptiness is form; 
the same for feelings, perceptions, volitional processes and consciousness.
Here, Sāriputta, all things have the characteristic of emptiness, 
neither arising nor ceasing; neither defiled nor pure, neither deficient nor complete.
Therefore, Sāriputta, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no volitional processes, no consciousness; 
no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind; 
no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or objects of mind; 
no eye-element up to no mind-consciousness element; 
no ignorance, no destruction of ignorance up to no old age and death, no destruction of old age and death; 
no suffering, arising, cessation, or path; 
no knowledge, no attainment, no non-attainment.
Therefore, Sāriputta, because of his non-attainment the Bodhisattva, having relied on the perfection of wisdom, dwells with his mind unobstructed. 
Given the unobstructed mind, he is not frightened, going beyond reversals, and attains the state of Nirvāṇa.
All the Buddhas abiding in the three times, having relied on the perfection of wisdom, are fully awake to the utmost, right, and perfect enlightenment.
Therefore it should be known that the perfection of wisdom is the great mantra, the mantra of great wisdom, the utmost mantra, the unequaled mantra, 
the remover of all sufferings, the truth out of righteousness. 
In the perfection of wisdom the mantra is uttered like this: 
Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone together beyond! Awakening! Hail!
